# Red Dog Productions Azure Demo Lab

Reddogproductions is a fictive IT service company that develops and consults on the Microsoft Azure platform.
RDP has offices in the US and Europe and share the same Azure AD, while Azure subscriptions are region bound.
While the offices have access restrictions due to Corona, RDP has enabled Windows Virtual Desktop for all employees who require access to internal applications.
After a successful pilot, RDP has decided to expand the scope and also offer personalized desktops for their developers and frontline workers.
