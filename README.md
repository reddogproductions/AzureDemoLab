## About The Demo

Even while WVD is a awesome service, internal employees are unable to show all related aspects due to Azure AD restrictions in the microsoft.onmicrosoft.com tenant. 
This demo environment has been setup in a rather special way (split setup over multiple tenants and subscriptions) to circumvent these shortcomings and also gives us the opportunity to showcase cross tenant/subscription functionality that's built-in to Azure.

## Getting Started

storyline: RedDogProductions is a fictive IT service company that develops and consults on the Microsoft Azure platform. RDP has offices in the US and Europe and share the same Azure AD, while Azure subscriptions are region bound. 

While the offices have access restrictions due to Corona, RDP has enabled Windows Virtual Desktop for all employees who require access to internal applications. 
After a successful pilot, RDP has decided to expand the scope and also offer personalized desktops for their developers and remote apps for frontline workers.
