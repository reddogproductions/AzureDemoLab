## Azure Custom Image

To create a custom image you first need to create your VM. When the VM is created, install all required software and configure your preferred settings. Once you have the VM just the way you like it you need to sysprep the VM, this means that we will strip the VM from it's unique security identifier (SID) and make it ready for a clean installation. By generalizing the VM we are able to create a 'out of the box' experience during install, but the advantage is all your applications and settings will already be there at first startup.

sysprep the VM:

When the process is done, go the the VM in the Azure portal and select the Capture button:

give the image a name that makes sense to you. You can delete the source VM as it can no longer be used after the sysprep (would not boot up properly in Azure)

Next time you will deploy a new VM you will be able to select your custom image

## Azure Shared Image Gallery

If you want to use versioning on your custom images, or replicate them to other regions then Azure Shared Image Gallery can be used. Same as with custom images, you can capture the image directly into existing Shared Image Gallery
