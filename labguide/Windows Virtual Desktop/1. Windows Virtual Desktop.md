# Windows Virtual Desktop

[TOC]

## Design

![wvd design](https://chlams.blob.core.windows.net/public/reddogproductions/design/crosstenant.png)

The overall design of the WVD Demo setup is based upon 2 tenants and 2 subscriptions:
**MSFT tenant/subscription:**
No rights on Azure AD, but we do have budget for the infra part on the AIRS subscription itself.
Infra: VM’ s, vWAN, Azure Firewall, vNET..
Access to this subscription is provided by Azure Lighthouse from the MSDN subscriptions

**MSDN tenants/subscriptions:**
Full rights on Azure AD, but limited budget. 
There are 25 M365 licenses assigned to this Azure AD.
This is where the WVD and Azure AD Premium services are created

## Demo WVD



> If it's the first time you will use your demo account, make sure you have gone through the steps to finalize the activation your account. Log into www.office.com to do so.


There are 2 clients available to access your WVD workspaces

1. HTML5 Browser: 

   the most easy and simple is to use a HTML 5 browser (Edge Chromium works best):

   Open following link: https://rdweb.wvd.microsoft.com/arm/webclient/index.html 

+ log in with yourname@reddogproductions.tech account

  ![wvd browser client](https://chlams.blob.core.windows.net/public/reddogproductions/pics/wvd/browserwvd.png)

2. WVD fat client

The Windows client can be downloaded [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-desktop/connect-windows-7-10#install-the-windows-desktop-client ). For other operating systems see the [readme](https://github.com/reddogproductions/AzureDemoLab/) file of this project.

Once installed, open the remote desktop app:

![w10 wvd client](https://chlams.blob.core.windows.net/public/reddogproductions/pics/wvd/w10wvdclient.png)

specify the feed URL https://rdweb.wvd.microsoft.com/api/arm/feeddiscovery

![wvd feed](https://chlams.blob.core.windows.net/public/reddogproductions/pics/wvd/wvdfeedurl.png)

and log in with yourname@reddogproductions.tech account

![login wvd](https://chlams.blob.core.windows.net/public/reddogproductions/pics/wvd/login.png)

All the apps are shown in the WVD client, but also show up in the start-up folder.

Opening remote applications have a 'like local' experience.
Applications will only show up when they are assigned to you, for example the SSMS database tool would be assigned to database admins and give them access to internal SQL applications.

## Show WVD in the Azure Portal

### Workspaces

![wvd workspaces](https://chlams.blob.core.windows.net/public/reddogproductions/pics/wvd/workspaces.png)

> Additional info:
>
> -	A workspace was called ‘tenant’ in the classic version of WVD 
> -	A workspace needs to exist before you can deploy host pools
> -	Each workspace can list different sets of host pools and application groups

### Host Pools

![wvd host pools](https://chlams.blob.core.windows.net/public/reddogproductions/pics/wvd/hostpools.png)

Host pool RDP settings:

![host pool settings](https://chlams.blob.core.windows.net/public/reddogproductions/pics/wvd/hostpoolsettings.png)

> Additional info:
> You need to link the Host Pools to Workspaces when creating them
> You need to create multiple host pools when: 
>
> -	You want to offer both Full Desktop & Remote Apps (cannot be combined)
> -	You need VM’s with and without GPU
> -	When you need different RDP properties 
>   (connection info / session behavior / device redirection)
>   A host pool can only be member of 1 WVD Workspace at the same time

### Application Groups

![wvd app groups](https://chlams.blob.core.windows.net/public/reddogproductions/pics/wvd/appgroups.png)

Once you have added applications, you need to assign users and/or groups:

![assign apps](https://chlams.blob.core.windows.net/public/reddogproductions/pics/wvd/assignapps.png)

> Additional info:
> Application Groups need to be linked to a Host Pool (and only 1 host pool)
> When assigning users: nested groups are not supported (group in group)
> Apps can be added by listing the apps installed on the Host Pool (portal) or by specifying the location of the app on the server.
