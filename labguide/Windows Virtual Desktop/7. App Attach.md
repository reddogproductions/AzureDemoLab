# MSIX App Attach

This demo environment has 2 available App Attach apps available, to view and change the configuration we will need to access the portal with a special preview link: <https://preview.portal.azure.com/?feature.msixapplications=true#home>

## The portal

If you want to add new MSIX apps to the App Appatch pool, open the VSE-RDP-EU-WVD-APPATTACH hostpool and click the add button:
![host pool](https://chlams.blob.core.windows.net/public/reddogproductions/pics/wvd/appattachhostpool.png)
Enter the location of the MSIX package to import it into the host pool.

Now go to the AppAttach application group and click the add button to import the application into the application group:
![application group](https://chlams.blob.core.windows.net/public/reddogproductions/pics/wvd/appattachappgroup.png)

and finally assign users to the application group.
