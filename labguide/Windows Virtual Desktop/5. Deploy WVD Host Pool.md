In this environment we are not able to use the portal WVD Wizard due to split environment. 
This tutorial will show you how to add a new VM from our custom images/Shared Image Gallery as member of a WVD Host Pool.

Navigate to the Azure portal and start the wizard to create a new Virtual Machine

![newhostpool1](https://chlams.blob.core.windows.net/public/reddogproductions/pics/hostpool/newvm1.png)

On the image selection, click the 'see all images' and select My Images or Shared Images in the left menu bar and finally select the VM image that you would like to deploy.

Select your preferred size and enter username and password.
As the VM will not be connected to the host pool, we need to allow access through the VM by assigning a public IP or by using Azure Bastion is that is available in your virtual network. Here we select to use the public IP and allow RDP access to it, we will remove the public IP after WVD setup is done. Don't forget to check the licensing checkbox ;)

As the WVD VM's will be stateless (non persistent), there is no need to add a data disk to the VM.
For the OS you can select the type that works best for your environment.

In the network section, select your VNET and subnet. Assign a (temporary) public IP to the VM's network card and allow RDP access to it from the internet.

select the monitoring options you would like to have enabled.

All other settings can be left to its default.

Download the Windows Desktop Client:



Once the VM is created, connect to it by using RDP from the portal and copy over the downloaded files
