# Azure Virtual Desktop Security

Windows Virtual Desktop already reduces the attack surface by removing open RDP ports to the internet by using [Reverse Connect](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-desktop/network-connectivity#reverse-connect-transport) Technology.

This Azure environment consists of muliptle security layers:

## Azure Security

Azure offers us many security solutions that we can apply

### Azure Security Center

All virtual machines are protected by Azure Defender (Standard) policy

Access to critical virtual machines are protected by Just in Time Access and Azure Bastion

## Azure Firewal (Secure vWAN hub)

All traffic between virtual networks and to the internet needs to pass the Azure Firewall.
These settings are managed with Azure Firewal Policies

(When you don't have a Azure Firewall, you can make use of Network Security Groups instead.)

## Azure Firewall Policies

AVD session hosts will at least need to be able to talk to a set of AVD platform services, but software running on the session hosts also will need to connect to the internet. All these rules are stored in the AVD_Firewall_Policy.

## Azure Active Directory Security

### Privileged Identity Management

Users can request Global Admin or Global Reader role to navigate the demo environment

### Conditional Access

access to all cloud applications is managed by CA

### Multi Factor Authentication

MFA is required for all users (with some exceptions)
