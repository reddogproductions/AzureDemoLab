## Start/Stop VM's

most of the VM's are created with the cost efficient B series, except the GPU enabled VM that is using NV6.
Except for the GPU VM, all others start automatically at 9AM and shut down at 6PM by **Azure Automation**

If you have the need to work with the environment outside of these hours or you need the GPU VM, you can start them up by using **Azure LightHouse**.
