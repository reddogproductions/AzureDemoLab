## Azure Lighthouse

Azure Lighthouse enables cross- and multi-tenant management, allowing for higher automation, scalability, and enhanced governance across resources and tenants.

With Azure Lighthouse, service providers can deliver managed services using comprehensive and robust management tooling built into the Azure platform. Customers maintain control over who can access their tenant, which resources they can access, and what actions can be taken. This offering can also benefit [enterprise IT organizations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/lighthouse/concepts/enterprise) managing resources across multiple tenants.

The [cross-tenant management experience](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/lighthouse/concepts/cross-tenant-management-experience) lets you work more efficiently with Azure management services like Azure Policy, Azure Security Center, and more. All service provider activity is tracked in the activity log, which is stored in the customer's tenant (and can be viewed by users in the managing tenant). Users can see what changes were made and by whom.
