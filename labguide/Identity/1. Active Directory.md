# Active Directory

All users are sourced from the RDP.NET domain controller (running in Azure), this DC is used for the [**Azure AD Connect tool**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-adconnectivitytools) that syncs all the users to Azure AD.
In this demo environment we have enabled Pass Through Authentication and Seamless SSO, the PTA settings can be shown in the Azure AD Connect tool.

To get access to this domain controller you need to follow following procedure:
Log into the Azure portal and select the **REDDOGPRODUCTIONS** Tenant
Select the [**Azure LightHouse**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/lighthouse/overview) service and select ‘Manage your customers’ and ‘delegations’.
Azure Lighthouse shows what you can do from a service provider perspective (you don’t have direct access to the MSFT subscription, however, you can manage it from the MSDN tenant/subscription by the delegated RBAC roles assigned to the service provider.

Select the reddogproductions MSFT (internal) subscription, from the new pane go to the resources option and filter on RDPDC01 and select the VM resource

Before we can login to the VM we will need to request [**Just in Time access**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security-center/security-center-just-in-time?tabs=jit-config-asc%2Cjit-request-asc). Select the RDP option.

As the Domain Controller does not have a public IP address assigned (it is impossible to attack from the internet), we will need to make use of [**Azure Bastion**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bastion/bastion-overview) to get access to the private IP of the VM.

Log in with your provided credentials (due to **Just in Time** it can take some time extra before you can log-in)

This domain controller also functions as DNS server and its private IP is specified as **[custom DNS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dns/dns-custom-domain)** on the Azure virtual networks. This is the only server that is running 24/7 (as the AD DS database could get damaged by putting the VM in deallocated mode)

## AD Users & Computers

ADUC resembles a few of the regions and business units in use today. Starting with the Belgian sub, all Azure Specialists, CSA's and managers user accounts have been created and are synchronized to Azure AD.

for compliance reasons, the full list of user accounts can be found in the Teams RedDogProductions channel under Files.
If your account is missing, leave a message in the Teams channel.
